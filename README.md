## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository documents my **Week 1 deliverables** from the *Data Visualization Associate Internship*, focusing on developing clean, structured, and analysis-ready data.  
It demonstrates the full workflow — from raw data exploration to PostgreSQL database creation — ensuring **data accuracy, reliability, and integrity** for later visualization.

---

## 🚀 Objectives

1. **Explore Datasets:**  
   - Applicant Data  
   - Outreach Data  
   - Campaign Data  

2. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Detect trends, patterns, missing values, and anomalies  
   - Visualize preliminary insights through charts and summaries  

3. **Clean & Validate Data:**  
   - Handle missing values and duplicates  
   - Correct inaccuracies and standardize formats  
   - Document cleaning steps and solutions  

4. **Set Up PostgreSQL Environment:**  
   - Create database and import cleaned datasets  
   - Run integrity queries to confirm data accuracy  

5. **Build a Master Table:**  
   - Integrate all datasets using common identifiers (Applicant ID, Campaign ID)  
   - Verify relational consistency across all data tables
