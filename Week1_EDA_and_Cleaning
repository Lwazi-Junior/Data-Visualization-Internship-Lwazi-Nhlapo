# 📅 Week 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Cleaning

Welcome to **Week 1** of the Data Visualization Internship project!  
In this phase, I focused on **data preparation, cleaning, and exploratory analysis** to ensure dataset accuracy and usability for visualization.

---

## 🧹 Objectives

- Import raw data from multiple sources (CSV / Excel)
- Handle missing values, duplicates, and data type inconsistencies
- Identify outliers and perform normalization where necessary
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover trends and patterns
- Generate initial summary reports and visualizations

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `EDA_Report.md` | Detailed report describing the data cleaning process and key insights from the exploratory data analysis |
| `SQL_DataProof.sql` | SQL queries used to validate data integrity, perform aggregation, and check consistency of key metrics |
| `cleaned_dataset.csv` | Processed dataset ready for visualization (if not sensitive) |

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python** – Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **SQL** – Data validation and integrity checks  
- **Excel / CSV** – Source data  
- **Power BI / Tableau** – Used in later weeks for visualization

---

## 📊 Summary of Insights

- Identified missing values in key numeric fields and imputed using median values  
- Removed 2% duplicate records from dataset  
- Found strong correlation between *marketing spend* and *customer engagement* metrics  
- Highlighted seasonal trends for further visualization in Week 2

---

## 📎 Next Steps

➡️ Proceed to **Week 2 – Data Visualization Design & Dashboard Building**, where the cleaned data will be visualized using Power BI and Python.
